This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where the route handler attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without checking for potential errors. This can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior if the ID is not a valid integer. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling using a try-catch block and input validation, making the application more robust and less prone to errors.
